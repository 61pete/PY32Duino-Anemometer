# PY32Duino-Anemometer

Basically turning a disposable vape into an anemometer using the NASTY BAR 20000 puffs from NASTY Juice CO in Malaysia.
So far Ive only come across 2 vapes that use the PY32F030EK28 mcu, the Nasty Bar 20000 and the BLVK Bar 20000.

These are the 2 vapes containing the F030EK28 mcu.
Standard batt is a li-ion 14500 800mah which I upgraded to a flatter style with 900mah.
